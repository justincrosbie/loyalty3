# selectize.js

Selectize is a jQuery-based custom &lt;select&gt; UI control. It's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. It clocks in at around ~7kb (gzipped). The goal is to provide a solid & usable user-experience with a clean and powerful API.

- [Examples](examples/)
- [Usage Documentation](docs/usage.md)
- [API Documentation](docs/api.md)

### Features

- **Smart Option Ranking**<br>As the user types, options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly.
- **Multi-property searching**<br>Want to search an item's title *and* description? No problem.
- **Caret between items**<br>Order matters sometimes. Use the [left] and [right] arrow keys to move between selected items.</li>
- **Select &amp; delete multiple items at once**<br>Hold down [option] on Mac or [ctrl] on Windows to select more than one item to delete.
- **Díåcritîçs supported**<br>Great for international environments.
- **Item creation**<br>Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).
- **Remote data loading**<br>For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.
- **Clean API &amp; code**<br>Interface with it and make modifications easily. Pull requests welcome!
- **Touch Support**<br> Plays nice with iOS 5+ devices.
