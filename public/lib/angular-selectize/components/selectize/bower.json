  "readme": "# selectize.js\n\nSelectize is a jQuery-based custom &lt;select&gt; UI control. It's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. It clocks in at around ~7kb (gzipped). The goal is to provide a solid & usable user-experience with a clean and powerful API.\n\n- [Demos](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/)\n- [Examples](examples/)\n- [Usage Documentation](docs/usage.md)\n- [API Documentation](docs/api.md)\n\n### Features\n\n- **Smart Option Ranking**<br>As the user types, options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly.\n- **Multi-property searching**<br>Want to search an item's title *and* description? No problem.\n- **Caret between items**<br>Order matters sometimes. Use the [left] and [right] arrow keys to move between selected items.</li>\n- **Select &amp; delete multiple items at once**<br>Hold down [option] on Mac or [ctrl] on Windows to select more than one item to delete.\n- **Díåcritîçs supported**<br>Great for international environments.\n- **Item creation**<br>Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).\n- **Remote data loading**<br>For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.\n- **Clean API &amp; code**<br>Interface with it and make modifications easily. Pull requests welcome!\n- **Touch Support**<br> Plays nice with iOS 5+ devices.\n\n### Usage\n\nIf using [Bower](http://bower.io/), run `bower install selectize`. Otherwise,\ngrab [\"selectize.min.js\"](selectize.min.js) (or [\"selectize.js\"](selectize.js)\nif in a development environment) and [\"selectize.css\"](selectize.css) and include them in your project.\n\n```js\n$('select').selectize(options);\n```\n\nThe available options are [documented here](docs/usage.md).\n\n#### IE8 Support\n\nTo support Internet Explorer 8, [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/) must be added your page.\n\n### Contributing\n\nTo test, build your copy with `make` then try out the [bundled examples](examples/).\n\nPlease exclude \"selectize.js\" and \"selectize.min.js\" in the project root when issuing a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2013 [Brian Reavis](http://twitter.com/brianreavis), & Contributors\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
